        "Hi Poom\r\n\r\nYes, there is a lot of information and instructions in the documents I\r\nsent.  For this week, a priority would be to log into easy-speak and follow\r\nthe link in the left-hand panel to the next meeting.  Once on the webpage\r\nfor the Nov 25th meeting, confirm that you will be attending.  This is\r\ncovered in pages 1 through 4 of the Easy-Speak Instructions document.\r\n\r\nReading the rest of the Easy-Speak manual will be helpful for future\r\nmeetings.  The meeting this week is our Evaluation Contest so it is a\r\nlittle unusual compared to our usual meeting agenda.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any other questions.\r\n\r\nAdrian\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Tue, 23 Nov 2021 at 08:59, poomrapee chuthamsatid <poomon2542@gmail.com>\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n> Hi Adrian,\r\n>\r\n> Thank you so much for the information!
